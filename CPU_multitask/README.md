##The CPU implementaion of parallelize hyperparameter tuning algorithm

This is the CPU simulation implementatino o fthe parallel hyperparamter 
tuning algorithm. 

It's using the individual CPU core as workers for training. And use the
asynchronously executing of threads through the ThreadPoolExecutor.

More details about this package can be found at:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html

It deployes three CPU workers. ANd creates a pool of 20 randomly 
generated int number within the range from 1 to 100. This pool is called cong
_pool, representing the combination of hyperparamter configurations generated by
random search method. The reason for using randomly generated int number
is to mimic the different processing time for individual GPU task. 
The function return__future_result is taking an entry from the cong_pool or 
rung_pool, sleep for a period of time and return the updated entry back to rung_pool.
